	<h4> Some notes regarding the current state of the game: </h4>
	<ul>
		<li> The game has been tested in Internet Explorer 10 and the most recent version of Firefox. If you are having trouble with another browser, try switching to one of those (but let us know about the problem). </li>
		<li> Your progress is saved automatically by the server. If you'd like to restart, go to the settings menu and click on the appropriate button. </li>
		<li> The TODO list app only displays meaningful objectives in the coffee shop scene. </li>
		<li> Video playback is not always stable. Sometimes the video cuts off after a few seconds. If you get stuck on a screen with a video, refresh the page. You'll skip past the video. </li>
		<li> The apartment scene is not scored correctly - you'll get 50 points if you complete the scene. </li>
		<li> Scoring for the coffee shop is based on the number of attempts it took you to complete it - replaying the module will not improve your score. </li>
		<li> You've finished the game when you reach a screen prompting you to take a survey. The survey was originally used with a class (HACS100), so the description of the survey may contain some irrelevant information. </li>
	</ul>
